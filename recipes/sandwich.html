    A Reuben sandwich is one of my family's fix-it-quick favorites. They are really delicious and easy to make. I like to serve them with big bowls of steaming vegetable soup and dill pickles on the side.

    A Reuben is a grilled sandwich featuring corned beef on rye bread. The Reuben is a menu staple in Jewish-style delicatessens, but it's not technically kosher because it combines meat and cheese.

<ul>
    <li>rye bread</li>
    <li>Thousand Island dressing</li>
    <li>Swiss cheese</li>
    <li>Corned beef</li>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
   <li>Preheat a large griddle or skillet over medium heat.</li>
   <li>Spread one side of bread slices evenly with Thousand Island dressing. On four bread slices, layer one slice Swiss cheese, 2 slices corned beef, 1/4 cup sauerkraut, and a second slice of Swiss cheese. Top with remaining bread slices, dressing-side down. Butter the top of each sandwich.</li>
